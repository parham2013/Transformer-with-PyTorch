The aim of this project is to construct a Transformer model using PyTorch. The Transformer is one of the most powerful models in modern machine learning. They have revolutionized the field, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as language translation and text summarization. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have been replaced by Transformers in these tasks due to their ability to handle long-range dependencies and parallel computations.

The tool utilized in this project to build the Transformer is PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library known for its simplicity, versatility, and efficiency. With a dynamic computation graph and extensive libraries, PyTorch has become a go-to for researchers and developers in the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
